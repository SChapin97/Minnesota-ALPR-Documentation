- Data collected by an Automated License Plate Reader **shall be destroyed no later than 60 days from the date of collection.**
  - Data may be **exempted** from this for the following reasons:
    - The data is **tied to an active criminal investigation** (once the criminal charge or complaint is resolved or dismissed, the data shall be destroyed)

- **A law enforcement agency that installs or uses an Automated License Plate Reader must maintain a public log of its use**, including but not limited to:
  - Specific times of day that the reader actively collected data
  - The aggregate number of vehicles or license plates collected during each period of active use
    - A list of all state and federal databases with which the data collected during this period was compared, unless the existence of the database itself is not public
  - The number of vehicles or license plates in each of the following categories where the data identified a vehicle or license plate that had been tied to:
    - A stolen vehicle / license plate
    - A warrant for the arrest of the owner of the vehicle
    - An owner with a suspended or revoked driver's license or similar category
    - Data that is subject to an active criminal investigation
  - Location for active and installed stationary or fixed Automated License Plate Reader devices
- **The law enforcement agency must maintain a list of the current and previous locations, including date at those locations, of any fixed stationary Automated License Plate Readers or other surveillance devices with similar capabilities which are used by the agency.**
  - **The agency's list must be accessible to the public unless the agency determines that the location data is classified as "security information"** (as defined in [statute 13.37, subdivision 1(a)](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13.37#stat.13.37.1))
    - A determination that the location of the Automated License Plate Reader(s) are security information is subject to in-camera judicial review as provided in [section 13.08 subdivision 4](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13.08#stat.13.08.4) (basically, you as an individual can fight the designation of the locations as security information in court)


### Subdivision 6: Biennial audit
- In addition to the log required under [subdivision 5](#Subdivision-5-log-of-use-required), the law enforcement agency must maintain records showing the date and time Automated License Plate Reader data was collected and the applicable classification of the data. **The law enforcement agency shall arrange for an independent, biennial (every two years) audit of the records** to determine whether the data currently in the records are:
  - Classified
  - How the data is used
  - Whether they are destroyed as required under this section
  - Verify the compliance with [subdivision 7](#Subdivision-7-Authorization-to-access-data)
- **If the commissioner of administration believes that a law enforcement agency is not complying with this section or other applicable law, the commissioner may order a law enforcement agency to arrange for additional independent audits.** Data in the records required under this paragraph are classifeid as provided in [subdivision 2](#Subdivision-2-Data-collection-classification-use-restrictions)
- The results of the audit are public. The commissioner of administration shall review the results of the audit. **If the commissioner determines that there is a pattern of substantial noncompliance with this section by the law enforcement agency, the agency must immediately suspend operation of all Automated License Plate Reader devices until the commissioner has authorized the agency to reinstate their use.** An order of suspension under this paragraph may be issued by the commissioner, upon review of the results of the audit, review of the applicable provisions of this chapter, and after providing the agency a reasonable opportunity to respond to the audit's findings.
- A report summarizing the results of each audit must be provided to the commissioner of administration, to the chairs and ranking minority members of the committees of the house of representatives and the senate with jurisdiction over data practices and public safety issues, and to the Legislative Commission on Data Practices and Personal Data Privacy no later than 30 days following the completion of the audit.
  - (Some of? all of?) these audit results can be found here: https://www.lrl.mn.gov/mndocs/mandates_detail?orderid=8735
    - I have also archived these in this repository here: [audit results](../public_records_documents/audit_results). I am going to try to keep this up to date, but I cannot make any promises on the currentness of these files.


### Subdivision 7: Authorization to access data
- A law enforcement agency must comply with the following sections of Minnesota law in the operation of Automated License Plate Readers, and in maintaining Automated License Plate Reader data:
  - [Section 13.05 subdivision 5: Data protection](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13.05#stat.13.05.5)
    - The responsible authority shall:
      - **Establish appropriate security safeguards for all records containing data on individuals**, including procedures for ensuring that data that are not public are only accessible to persons whose work assignment reasonably requires access to the data, and is only being accessed by those persons for purposes described in the procedure
      - **Develop a policy incorporating these procedures**, which may include a model policy governing access to the data if sharing of the data with other government entities is authorized by law.
      - When not public data is being disposed of, **the data must be destroyed in a way that prevents its contents from being determined.**
  - [Section 13.055: Disclosure of breach in security; notification and investigation report required](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13.055)
    - Tl;dr: If a data security breach happens, the authority must notify individuals whom may be impacted and an investigation into the breach must be commenced.
- The **responsible authority for a law enforcement agency must establish written procedures to ensure that law enforcement personnel have access to the data only if authorized in writing by the chief of police, sheriff, or head of the law enforcement agency, or their designee, to obtain access to data collected by an automated license plate reader for a legitimate, specified, and documented law enforcement purpose.** Consistent with the requirements of paragraph (c), each access must be based on a reasonable suspicion that the data are pertinent to an active criminal investigation and must include a record of the factual basis for the access and any associated case number, complaint, or incident that is the basis for the access.
- **The ability of authorized individuals to enter, update, or access automated license plate reader data must be limited through the use of role-based access that corresponds to the official duties or training level of the individual and the statutory authorization that grants access for that purpose.** All queries and responses, and all actions in which data are entered, updated, accessed, shared, or disseminated, must be recorded in a data audit trail. Data contained in the audit trail are public, to the extent that the data are not otherwise classified by law.


### Subdivision 8: Notification to Bureau of Criminal Apprehension
- **Each law enforcement agency must send the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension a list of any new Automated License Plate Readers within 10 days of the installation or current use of said devices (or enablement of Automated License Plate Reader technology in an existing device).**
- The list must contain the locations of any fixed stationary Automated License Plate Readers or other devices.
  - This list will be made to the public on the [Bureau of Criminal Apprehension's website](https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/bca/data-and-reports/agencies-use-lprs-lpr).
  - If the agency considers the location of a device to be classified as "security information" (as defined in [statute 13.37, subdivision 1(a)](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13.37#stat.13.37.1)), they may have the location of the device redacted from both the Bureau's website as well as any [data request](minnesota_governmental_data_practices_act.md).
